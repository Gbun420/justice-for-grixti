        <p>We adhere to the following data protection principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency:</strong> We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.</li>
          <li><strong>Purpose limitation:</strong> We collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes only, and do not further process it in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> We collect only adequate, relevant, and limited personal data necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.</li>
          <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.</li>
          <li><strong>Storage limitation:</strong> We keep personal data in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrity and confidentiality:</strong> We process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to privacy by design and collect minimal personal data. We do not track IP addresses, use third-party tracking cookies (beyond essential functionality for user experience), or log detailed metadata about your visit.</p>
